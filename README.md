# Groupbuy Coordinator
 Discord Bot to assist in multi-user donations for a singular item.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0bscenity/Groupbuy-Coordinator.git
cd .\Groupbuy-Coordinator\
npm install
```

---

## Configuration

In order to run the Groupbuy Coordinator on your own bot, you'll have to edit the **`config.json`** to include your own Token and IDs.

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN",
    "bot_owner_id": "OWNER_ID",
    "bot_id": "BOT_ID"
}
```
**Token:** is available at https://discord.com/developers/applications/XXX/bot

*Replace `XXX` with your Bot's ID*

While you're here, you must enable Privileged Gateway Intents so you bot can utilise features of Discord.

You must enable "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" and "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT".

You can enable "PRESENCE INTENT" if you wish to program features to do with that.


*To get User IDs, you must enable Developer Mode in `Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode`* 

**Owner ID:** Right-click your own name in Discord -> `Copy ID`

**Bot ID:** This is the same as `XXX` from above - Right-click your bot in Discord -> `Copy ID`

---

## Running

To enable */commands*, run 
```javascript
node register.js
```

Then to bring the bot to life, run
```javascript
node groupbuy.js
```

This command will need to remain running for the bot to function.
*I'd recommend installing a process manager like [PM2](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html#installation)*


Now you can invite the bot to your server

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXX&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

*Replace `XXX` with your Bot's ID*

Once the bot is in your server, in chat type the following:

```
/create
```

**This will completely wipe the server and generate new channels and roles - use with caution.**
